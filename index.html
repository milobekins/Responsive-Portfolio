                    Greetings! My name is Milo Bekins, I'm a web developer located in the East Bay. My educational background is in the biological sciences, however I enjoy learning about a diverse variety of subjects- ranging from math, physics, chemistry to geology astronomy and the arts. <br><br>Lately I have been trying my hand at computer programming, drawn to its mix of linguistic complexity and creative freedom. <br><br>I look to make the most out of my time during this bootcamp, and focus on <strong>learning to enjoy the learning process</strong>. I expect that the course will require me to also expand other skills beyond my limited programming knowledge, such as my ability to be patient and cope with stress. Overall I intend to take things as they come, and try to approach each challenge as an opportunity for personal growth.
